  return (
    <>

  );
}

## Real-time Integration

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)
The social system uses SSE for real-time updates:

- **Notification Stream** (`/api/notifications/stream`) - Friend requests, messages, system notifications
- **Message Stream** (`/api/messages/stream`) - Real-time message delivery and read receipts
- **Connection Management** - Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

### tRPC API Integration

The components integrate with the following tRPC routers:

#### User Router (`api.user`)
- `getFriends` - Retrieve user's friend list with pagination
- `searchUsers` - Search users by username, name, or email
- `getUserProfile` - Get detailed user profile information
- `updateProfile` - Update user profile and preferences
- `getBlockedUsers` - Retrieve blocked users list
- `blockUser` / `unblockUser` - Block/unblock user management

#### Friend Request Router (`api.friendRequest`)
- `send` - Send new friend request with optional message
- `getReceived` - Get incoming friend requests with pagination
- `getSent` - Get outgoing friend requests with status
- `respond` - Accept or decline friend request
- `cancel` - Cancel sent friend request
- `remove` - Remove existing friendship

#### Message Router (`api.message`)
- `getConversations` - Get conversation list with unread counts
- `getConversation` - Get message history for specific conversation
- `send` - Send new message with delivery confirmation
- `markAsRead` - Mark messages as read with timestamps
- `getUnreadCount` - Get total unread message count
- `searchConversations` - Search through conversation history

#### Notification Router (`api.notification`)
- `getAll` - Get user notifications with filtering
- `markAsRead` - Mark single or multiple notifications as read
- `markAllAsRead` - Mark all notifications as read
- `getUnreadCount` - Get unread notification count
- `dismiss` - Dismiss/delete specific notifications

## Styling

Uses Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/ui components:
- Dialog for popup overlay

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Escape` - Close popup

- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo patterns
- Auto-scroll to new messages
- Optimistic updates for better UX
