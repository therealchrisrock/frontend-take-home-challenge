# SSE Infrastructure Cleanup Summary

## Completed Cleanup Tasks

### 1. ✅ Deleted Old SSE API Routes
- Removed `/src/app/api/notifications/stream/`
- Removed `/src/app/api/messages/stream/`
- Removed `/src/app/api/game/[id]/mp-stream/`

### 2. ✅ Deleted SSE Client Libraries
- Removed `/src/lib/sse/` directory completely
  - `enhanced-client.ts`
  - `sse-hub.ts`
  - `types.ts`

### 3. ✅ Cleaned Up Unused Contexts
- Removed `/src/contexts/notification-context.tsx`
- Updated `ChatContext.tsx` to remove SSE client imports and usage

### 4. ✅ Updated tRPC Routers
- **friendRequest.ts**: Removed SSEHub imports and broadcasts, now using EventEmitter only
- **message.ts**: Removed SSEHub imports and broadcasts, replaced with EventEmitter events

### 5. ✅ Updated Components
- **messages/page.tsx**: Removed SSE client usage
- **ChatContext.tsx**: Removed SSE client references

### 6. ✅ Cleaned Up Notification Utilities
- Removed `reducer.ts` and `reducer.test.ts`
- Removed `session-manager.ts` and test file
- Kept only `utils.ts` and `types.ts` (still needed)

### 7. ✅ Cleaned .next Cache
- Removed stale type definitions for deleted routes

## Architecture Now

All real-time functionality is now unified through:

```text
tRPC Subscription (SSE) → EventContext → Event Hooks → Components
```

### Components Using the New System
- **NotificationBell**: Uses `useNotifications()` from EventContext
- **FriendMessagePopup**: Uses `useUnreadMessageCounts()` and `useFriendRequests()`
- **MessageCenter**: Uses `useMessages()` and real-time hooks

### Remaining TODOs (marked in code)
- Update `ChatContext.tsx` to use EventContext for real-time updates
- Update `messages/page.tsx` to use EventContext for real-time updates
- Update game sync hooks to use EventContext

## Benefits of This Cleanup

1. **Single SSE Connection**: All real-time events go through one tRPC subscription
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support through tRPC and event types
3. **Simplified Architecture**: No more manual SSE client management
4. **Better Performance**: Single connection instead of multiple SSE streams
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Centralized event handling in EventContext

## Files Deleted (15+ files)
- 3 API route directories
- 3 SSE client library files  
- 1 old notification context
- 4 notification utility files
- Various test and type files

The codebase is now significantly cleaner and more maintainable!
