# Chinook-Inspired Checkers AI System Proposal

## Overview
This proposal outlines a sophisticated checkers AI system inspired by Chinook, the first computer program to win a world championship against humans. Our implementation will feature multiple difficulty levels ranging from random moves (easiest) to an expert-level AI using advanced algorithms and game knowledge.

## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. AI Engine (`src/lib/ai-engine.ts`)
The main AI class that handles move selection using various algorithms based on difficulty level.

#### 2. Difficulty Levels
- **Random**: Completely random legal moves
- **Easy**: Shallow search (2-ply), basic evaluation
- **Medium**: Moderate search (4-ply), improved evaluation
- **Hard**: Deep search (6-ply), advanced heuristics
- **Expert**: Maximum depth (8-ply), full feature set

#### 3. Search Algorithm
**Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**
- Explores game tree to find optimal moves
- Alpha-beta pruning reduces search space by ~50%
- Iterative deepening for time management
- Move ordering to improve pruning efficiency

#### 4. Position Evaluation Function
Evaluates board positions using weighted features:
- **Material Count**: Basic piece values (regular=100, king=150-200)
- **King Advancement**: Bonus for pieces close to promotion
- **Center Control**: Controlling central squares
- **Mobility**: Number of available moves
- **Back Row Defense**: Protecting the back row
- **Piece Protection**: Pieces protected by others
- **Tempo**: Turn advantage

#### 5. Performance Optimizations
- **Transposition Table**: Cache evaluated positions
- **Iterative Deepening**: Gradually increase search depth
- **Time Management**: Configurable time limits per move
- **Move Ordering**: Evaluate captures first
- **Quiescence Search**: Extend search in tactical positions

#### 6. Game Knowledge Databases
- **Opening Book**: Pre-computed strong opening sequences
- **Endgame Database**: Perfect play for positions with ≤6 pieces
- **Pattern Recognition**: Common tactical patterns
