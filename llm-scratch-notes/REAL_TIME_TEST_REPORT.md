# Real-Time Notification System Test Report

## Implementation Summary
We've successfully updated the notification and messaging systems to use the unified SSE stream via tRPC subscriptions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed useNotifications Hook
- Added `connectionState` property for notification-bell compatibility
- Added `refetch` function for manual refresh capability
- Maps EventContext state to expected format

### 2. Updated EventContext Initialization
- Removed filter on initial notifications (was filtering out read notifications)
- Now correctly initializes with all notifications from server
- Maintains unread count separately

### 3. Updated FriendMessagePopup Component
- Now uses `useUnreadMessageCounts` for real-time message counts
- Uses `useFriendRequests` for real-time friend request counts
- Removed polling-based approach in favor of real-time updates

### 4. Updated MessageCenter Component
- Replaced manual SSE client with unified event hooks
- Uses `useMessages` for real-time message data
- Uses `useUnreadMessageCounts` for badge counts
- Removed duplicate mark-as-read logic

## Testing Checklist

### Real-Time Notification Flow
- [ ] Friend request sent → Notification bell badge updates immediately
- [ ] Friend request sent → Toast notification appears immediately
- [ ] Friend request sent → Notification appears in dropdown immediately
- [ ] Friend request accepted → Sender receives immediate notification
- [ ] Friend request declined → Notification removed immediately

### Real-Time Message Flow
- [ ] Message sent → Recipient's message badge updates immediately
- [ ] Message sent → Recipient receives toast notification
- [ ] Message sent → Message appears in chat immediately
- [ ] Message read → Sender sees read status update
- [ ] Typing indicator → Shows in real-time

### Connection Management
- [ ] Green dot when connected
- [ ] Yellow dot when reconnecting
- [ ] Red dot when disconnected
- [ ] Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff

## Key Components Using Real-Time Data

1. **NotificationBell** (`/src/components/notifications/notification-bell.tsx`)
   - Uses `useNotifications()` hook
   - Shows unread count badge
   - Connection status indicator
   - Real-time notification list

2. **FriendMessagePopup** (`/src/components/social/FriendMessagePopup.tsx`)
   - Uses `useUnreadMessageCounts()` for message badge
   - Uses `useFriendRequests()` for friend request badge
   - Real-time updates for both tabs

3. **MessageCenter** (`/src/components/social/MessageCenter.tsx`)
   - Uses `useMessages()` for chat data
   - Real-time message sending and receiving
   - Typing indicators

4. **EventContext** (`/src/contexts/event-context.tsx`)
   - Central hub for all real-time data
   - Single tRPC SSE subscription
   - Distributes events to all components

## Next Steps

1. **Manual Testing Required**
   - Open two browser tabs with different user accounts
   - Test friend request flow
   - Test messaging flow
   - Verify immediate updates in all UI components

2. **Cleanup Tasks**
   - Remove old SSE endpoints (`/api/notifications/stream`, `/api/messages/stream`)
   - Remove unused SSE client utilities
   - Clean up any remaining polling-based code

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor SSE connection stability
   - Check for memory leaks
   - Verify reconnection logic works properly

## Expected Behavior

When a user sends a friend request:
1. ✅ Recipient's notification bell badge increments immediately
2. ✅ Recipient sees toast notification immediately
3. ✅ Notification appears in recipient's dropdown immediately
4. ✅ FriendMessagePopup shows pending request count immediately

When a user sends a message:
1. ✅ Recipient's message badge updates immediately
2. ✅ Message appears in chat window immediately
3. ✅ Conversation list updates with last message
4. ✅ Unread count updates in all relevant components

## Technical Architecture

All components now receive real-time updates through a single, unified SSE connection managed by tRPC subscriptions.
