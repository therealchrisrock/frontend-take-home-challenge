### Authentication Components to Test
1. **NextAuth Configuration** (`src/server/auth.ts`)
   - Session callbacks
   - JWT callbacks
   - Provider configurations (Discord, Credentials)
   - Prisma adapter integration

2. **tRPC Procedures** (`src/server/api/routers/auth.ts`)
   - register
   - setUsername
   - checkUsername
   - requestPasswordReset
   - resetPassword
   - updateProfile

3. **UI Components** (`src/app/auth/*`)
   - SignIn page
   - Password reset pages
   - New user setup page
   - Profile components

### Mock Strategy
