# Checkers Game - T3 Stack Implementation

A modern TypeScript implementation of Checkers built with the [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/), featuring real-time gameplay, multi-tab synchronization, and offline support.

## Design Notes & Trade-offs

Detailed architectural decisions and implementation trade-offs are documented in the following notes:

- [**Architecture Overview**](./notes/01-architecture-overview.md) - T3 Stack choice, project structure, routing strategy
- [**State Management**](./notes/02-state-management.md) - React state, persistence layers, optimistic updates
- [**Game Logic Separation**](./notes/03-game-logic-separation.md) - Pure functions vs UI components, validation architecture
- [**Multi-Tab Synchronization**](./notes/04-multi-tab-sync.md) - BroadcastChannel API, master election, fallback strategies
- [**Offline Support**](./notes/05-offline-support.md) - PWA approach, storage strategy, conflict resolution
- [**UI Component Architecture**](./notes/06-ui-component-architecture.md) - Shadcn/ui integration, responsive design, 3D backgrounds
- [**Performance Optimizations**](./notes/07-performance-optimizations.md) - Rendering strategy, bundle optimization, AI workers

### Design Notes Management

The design documentation is actively maintained using the [Design Notes Manager Agent](./notes/DESIGN_NOTES_AGENT.md). This agent:
- Keeps documentation synchronized with code changes
- Creates notes for new architectural decisions
- Removes obsolete documentation
- Updates trade-offs as implementation evolves

To request a documentation review: "Review and update the design notes based on recent changes"
